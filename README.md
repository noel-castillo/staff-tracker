# Staff Scheduler:
 
A full-stack web application using Java, Maven, and Spring Boot for the backend. Angular, Typescript, HTML, and CSS for frontend. PostgreSQL for the database. This application allows for a user to create a work week for their place of business, and then create individual positions per day that can then be filled by allocating an employee to the position. The work week, individual days, positions, and employees can all be created, edited, deleted, or retrieved from the database. The application also allows a user to view the complete schedule for each individual employee by listing their upcoming positions, dates and shifts.
